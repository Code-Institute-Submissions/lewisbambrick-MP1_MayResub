![main-image](assets/images/read-me-main-image.jpg)

The Website I created provides information about both indoor, outdoor rock climbing and locations for rock climbing.

This website is for educational purposes only and cannot be used as a template for use by a buisness.
The aim of this project is to build a website using only HTML and CSS.
