# Features of The Site

The website that I have created is made up of 4 pages. Three of those pages are part of the normal navigation of the website that is accessible from the navigation links.
The last page is just a submission confirmation page from the on the Contact-Us page form.

The Features of my website are:

## Header
    The header is fixed to the top of the screen so it's always visible to the user.
* ### Logo
    The logo on the site is on the left side of my header. The logo is also a navigation link to bring the user back to the home page.

* ### Navigation Bar
    The Navigation bar is located on the right side of the header.The nav bar is adaptive and will change position to under the logo when a screen moves to under the logo.
    The Nav bar consists of three links:    
    - Home 
    - Locations
    - Contact Us
    The links have a hover styling on them that underlines them while you hover over them. There is also an active styling on it. This makes the link for the page that the user is currently on be underlined, that way they can always see what page they're on.

## Main Image
    Each page has a main image that the user starts out on.
* ### Images 
    All of the images that I used for the main images were sourced from pexels, a free to use image website. Each mail image for each page is a different one to help the user know what page they are on.

* ### Animation 
    Both the main images for the Home page and the Locations page have keyframes animation.The animation I have gone for was a zoom animation, this give the effect of the main image zooming in when the user visits the page.

## Footer
     For my site I decided to keep the footer very simple. To achieve this I decided to just keep the footer content down to just social media links. The links that I used for the social media links were from The Wall Climbing Gym.

## Home 
* ### Indoor Bouldering
    This is the first section of home page unique content. This section starts off with an eye catching heading ensuring the user knows exactly what theyre looking at.
    There are also two images and text content, these are centered around the basics of indoor bouldering.

* ### Outdoor Bouldering
    This is the second section of the home pages unique content. This section also starts off with a great heading to help the user out. Like the first section this section also comprises of two images and text content, however this one is all about Outdoor Bouldering.

## Locations 
    The Locations page consists of a list of places to rock climb all across Ireland. Each place comprises of an image, a heading with the place name, and also a brief description of the place.
    The list is evenly split between indoor and outdoor places.

## Contact Us
    The content for the Contact-Us page that is unique to that page is just the form. This form is to contact the owners of the website about any rock climbing questions the user has.
    The form consists of basic information collection, such as First Name, Last Name, Email Address and their question and preference on type of rock climbing.

## future implementation 
    * Regular updates and expanding of the locations list.
    * Possibly adding and events page and adding a call to action on the home page for it.
    * Updates to the basics of rock climbing.

# Testing

## Compatability testing
    I tested my site on multiple devices and browswers. I did this by using the Chrome developement tools on my Chrome book.
    My site was also tested on my Chromebook, an iphone 5 and a Google Pixel 4a.

## Functionality testing
    For the duration of my project I used my Chrome developer tools to keep testing with styles and responsiveness.

## User Story testing

### As a new User:
- I would like to be able to find out what rock climing is and basic information about it easily.
    > Information about Rock climbing is clear and easy to find on the first page users visit the site on. The information is eye catching, and clearly seperated into sections for both indoor and outdoor bouldering.
- I would like to find out information about where I can boulder across Ireland, and a brief description of them.
    > Locations page is very easy to find for Users. Once they get to that page it is real easy to find the locations we have on the page, and the information about that location.
- I would like to be able to ask any question I have about bouldering that the site didnt already answer.
    > Contact Us page is very easy to find for all Users to find. Once users get there the Form is visible straight away. The Form is also easy to use and eye catching.

### As a Returning User:
- I would like to be able to return and ask any new questions I might have.
    > Form leaves it open to always ask anything about Rock climbing so it is very easy to return to ask new questions.
- I would like to be able to return to find more information about different locations to go bouldering. 
    > Locations page has multiple locations, so after a user learns about and visits a location, they can return to learn about others.

### As the Site Owner:
- I would like my users to be able to navigate and find the information they need to on my site as smooth and easily as possible.
    > Navigation menu is easy to find and stays fixed to the top of the screen.
- I would like my users to not hesitate in sending off their questions to me.
    >The Contact Us form is very eye catching, simple and friendly.
- I would like my customers to recognize the site as a reliable site with accurate information.
    >All the information used is very accurate and trust worthy, and will build the reputation for that.

## Issues and Fixes
- ### Menu was out of order
    While I was creating the Nav menu for my website I had forgotten to order the list backwards for when Floating the list items.
    > This was fixed by simply rearranging the order of my menu in the HTML code.

- ### Main image on Contact Us page was off center
    After creating the Contact Us page I realized that I had forgotten to center the image.
    > This was easily fixed by adding the Center shorthand on to the end of the image link.

- ### Youtube link was broken.
    While testing my site at the end of creating it I noticed that the Youtube link for my social media links in the footer was broken.
    >This was because I had made a typo that had the https part of the link repeated. I fixed this simply by deleting one of the https's

## Code Validation
    At the end of my Project I Validated both my CSS code and my HTML code using:
 -  [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS.
 - [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML.

## Performance Test
    To test the performance of my site I used the Google developer tool, Lighthouse.
    Find screenshot below:
