The Website I created provides information about both indoor, outdoor rock climbing and locations for rock climbing.

This website is for educational purposes only and cannot be used as a template for use by a buisness.
The aim of this project is to build a website using only HTML and CSS.

# Features of The Site

The website that I have created is made up of 4 pages. Three of those pages are part of the normal navigation of the website that is accessible from the navigation links.
The last page is just a submission confirmation page from the on the Contact-Us page form.

The Features of my website are:

## Header
    The header is fixed to the top of the screen so it's always visible to the user.
* ### Logo
    The logo on the site is on the left side of my header. The logo is also a navigation link to bring the user back to the home page.

* ### Navigation Bar
    The Navigation bar is located on the right side of the header.The nav bar is adaptive and will change position to under the logo when a screen moves to under the logo.
    The Nav bar consists of three links:    
    - Home 
    - Locations
    - Contact Us
    The links have a hover styling on them that underlines them while you hover over them. There is also an active styling on it. This makes the link for the page that the user is currently on be underlined, that way they can always see what page they're on.

## Main Image
    Each page has a main image that the user starts out on.
* ### Images 
    All of the images that I used for the main images were sourced from pexels, a free to use image website. Each mail image for each page is a different one to help the user know what page they are on.

* ### Animation 
    Both the main images for the Home page and the Locations page have keyframes animation.The animation I have gone for was a zoom animation, this give the effect of the main image zooming in when the user visits the page.

## Footer
     For my site I decided to keep the footer very simple. To achieve this I decided to just keep the footer content down to just social media links. The links that I used for the social media links were from The Wall Climbing Gym.

## Home 
* ### Indoor Bouldering
    This is the first section of home page unique content. This section starts off with an eye catching heading ensuring the user knows exactly what theyre looking at.
    There are also two images and text content, these are centered around the basics of indoor bouldering.

* ### Outdoor Bouldering
    This is the second section of the home pages unique content. This section also starts off with a great heading to help the user out. Like the first section this section also comprises of two images and text content, however this one is all about Outdoor Bouldering.

## Locations 
    The Locations page consists of a list of places to rock climb all across Ireland. Each place comprises of an image, a heading with the place name, and also a brief description of the place.
    The list is evenly split between indoor and outdoor places.

## Contact Us
    The content for the Contact-Us page that is unique to that page is just the form. This form is to contact the owners of the website about any rock climbing questions the user has.
    The form consists of basic information collection, such as First Name, Last Name, Email Address and their question and preference on type of rock climbing.

## future implementation 
    * Regular updates and expanding of the locations list.
    * Possibly adding and events page and adding a call to action on the home page for it.
    * Updates to the basics of rock climbing.
