            <h2>The Scalp</h2>
            <p>Beyond Kilternan the Dublin to Enniskerry road dives through a narrow rocky pass, formed by an Ice Age
                glacial lake overflow (Grid. 21 20). There are many granite outcrops and boulders, especially on the
                wooded eastern side, which offer short steep climbs. Most of them are crack or chimney problems, and
                they tend to be strenuous rather than delicate. The climbs are ideal for a short sunny winter afternoon,
                or a fine summer evening. It is pleasant to combine a few climbs with a short walk over Barnaslingan. There are fine views over the sea, and the Wicklow
                Hills.
